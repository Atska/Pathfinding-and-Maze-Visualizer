## Introduction

This project is showcasing pathfinding and maze algorithms. At the beginning I was interested in the basics of software engineering and wanted to learn more about algorithms and data structures. At the end I did this fun, challenging, furiously frustrating yet so extremly rewarding project.

#### What I learned
- Algorithmic thinking: Slicing a problem in many different subproblems and solve each of them step by step.
- Datastructures: Queues, stacks, heaps, sets and so on. When to use them and write one on your own if you need it.
- Graph traversal: Must-know stuff like depth-first-search or breadth-first-search, writing recursive function and its pros and cons.
- That I am still shit at css.

#### Technologies

- Javascript ES6
- ReactJS

Note: This project was developed with Google Chrome and its not optimized for phone usage. It was written with a 27inch monitor and a 14inch" laptop.
